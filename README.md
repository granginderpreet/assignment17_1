1. Declared the following models:
    "Nearest Neighbors",
    "Linear SVM",
    "RBF SVM",
    "Gaussian Process",
    "Decision Tree",
    "Random Forest",
    "Neural Net",
    "AdaBoost",
    "Naive Bayes",
    "QDA",
2. Started with testing on simple data sets: make_moons, makecircles and linerly separable.
3. Iterated through various classifiers and display the score.
4. Now start with a new data set for California housing market.
5. Predicted the median house value based on its longitide/latitude. Obsevred most of the expensive houses are on the coast line. 
6. Selected the top two parameters based on cross validation results.
7. Did Label encoding to limit the range of values
8. Iterated through various classifiers and did the scatter plot. 

Results

Various models were experimented and we found that Gaussian process provided the best score of 54.5 %
